# scrum-ban

## Description
This document is meant to sum-up my personal experiences, and advice I have received along the way for discussion and presentatation purposes.

## Idea
Some of the good points I see in Scrum:
* Well structured and organized.
* All team members get visibility of what is going on.
* Helps with planning and estimation.
* Should allow for swift unblocking of team members.

Some of the negatives I see in Scrum:
* Can be implemented too rigidly, with too much beaurocracy, thus wasting the team's time.
* Meetings, if not prepared for, can drag on too much.
* The whole concept of "anyone can do anything" is a tad too idealistic in my view, especially in smaller companies.

Scrum Master's job being "to unblock the team", in my view, in addition to making sure that each team member can continue with their daily work unimpeded, it also implies that they should not waste their time on the Scrum process too much, and it should be made as invisible as possible by the Scrum Master. Meetings should be well prepared for, and only scheduled when there is an actual need to do so, as well as a concrete target for the meeting.

Regarding the "anyone can do anything" part, it is good in principle, in the sense that if a team member goes absent, the other members can still pick his work up with no problems. However, if a team works on a product which covers many layers of abstraction, then this starts working less well in my experience - people still naturally tend to want to work on things that interest them, and I believe playing to people's strengths can be very benificial. To avoid the issue that once that team member goes AWOL development in their area stops, there should someone who "shadows them" - joins most of the meetings and observes all reviews. Due to standard Scrum meetings like grooming and the daily scrum, other people should have a general idea of whay's going on as well. Lastly, if there is time to prepare for a team member's leaving, implementation-level knowledge transfer should be done via documentation or special sessions with the people interested in receiving this information.
